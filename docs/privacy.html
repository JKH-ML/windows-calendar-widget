  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>This policy applies to the Windows Calendar Widget (“the app”) maintained by JKH-ML.</p>

  <h2>Information We Access</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Google Calendar events: titles, start/end times, all-day status, recurrence info, locations, descriptions, colors.</li>
    <li>Google account basics for sign-in: name, email, profile picture.</li>
    <li>Authentication tokens from Google (access/refresh tokens) to keep you signed in.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To display your calendar events and holidays in the desktop widget.</li>
    <li>To let you create, update, and delete calendar events you choose to manage via the app.</li>
    <li>Account name/email/avatar are shown only to indicate which account is signed in.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Storage & Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No data is sent to or stored on our servers; the app has no backend.</li>
    <li>Event data and tokens are stored locally on your device in <code>%AppData%/calendar-widget</code> (SQLite database and token JSON).</li>
    <li>When you log out inside the app, local tokens and cached events are cleared.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your Google data with third parties.</p>

  <h2>User Control & Revocation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can log out in the app to clear local data and stop further access.</li>
    <li>You can revoke the app’s Google access anytime at <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions">Google Account permissions</a>.</li>
    <li>If you revoke access, the app immediately loses permission to read or write your calendar.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Google API Services</h2>
  <p>This app’s use and transfer of information received from Google APIs adheres to the Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>All communication with Google APIs uses HTTPS. Data is stored only on your device; please keep your device and operating system secure.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy for clarity or compliance. Material changes will be reflected on this page with a revised date.</p>
